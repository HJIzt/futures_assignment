    "In this first part of Assignment 1, you will be analyzing a DataFrame containing palm oil futures contracts from 2019-2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each column is a specific contract, for a palm future with a given delivery date, while each row represents one trading day. Because the month columns are in chronological order from left to right, slicing out one row gives us the path of palm oil future prices, known as the \"Forward Curve.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, you will slice out specific days from each year, and then plot these Forward Curves to visually estimate if the market is in Contango (with rising futures prices) or Backwardation (declining futures prices).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: You may find it easier to work by breaking your code up between cells, to run them individually. In Colab, click \"Insert\" at the top of the screen, then \"Code Cell\" to add one below your current cell."
